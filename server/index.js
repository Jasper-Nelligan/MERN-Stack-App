 * 
 * With older versions of Node express would have to be imported like so:
 *    const express = require('express');
 * 
 * To enable the newer syntax using the import statement, the line:
 *    type: "module",
 * was added to package.json.

 * body-parser is used to process POST requests. A POST request is used to
 * send data to a server so it can create/update a resource. body-parser
 * extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes
 * it on req.body.
 * 
 * body-parser is an example of middleware. Express middleware are functions
 * that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each
 * middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path)
 * itâ€™s attached to. Middleware can either terminate the HTTP request or pass it
 * on to another middleware function. Middleware is set up using app.use() below.

 * CORS is a mechanism to allow or restrict requested resources on a web server
 * depending on where the HTTP request was initiated. This policy is used to
 * secure a certain web server from access by other websites or domains. CORS is
 * really useful when you're offering a public API and would like to control
 * the access to certain resources and how people use them.
 * 
 * For example, if you are currently on http://example.com/page1 and you are referring an image
 * from http://image.com/myimage.jpg you won't be able to fetch that image unless
 * http://image.com allows cross-origin sharing with http://example.com. By default
 * requests from any other origins will be restricted by the browser.
 * 
 * In this example, the frontend application was running on http://localhost:3000.
 * Meanwhile, the server was running on http://localhost:5000. Because of this,
 * CORS is needed between server and client so they can communicate.
